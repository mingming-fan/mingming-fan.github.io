<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to work in groups to solve a relatively complex IoT project that involving using one of the taught sensing technologies and Photon's internet connectivity to solve an interesting problem./p>
<p>You team's final project must:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use one of the two taught sensing technologies: capacitive sensing or active acoustic sensing
		 (Note that temperature sensor and passive infrared sensor are too simple to be qualified for the final project. However, if your team has an idea of using these sensors in a comprehensive way, send me a slack message to discuss.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Use Photon's Internet Connectivity: your team's final prototype must be able to send sensed data to a webserver over Internet
	</li>
	<li>
		Visualize sensed data
	</li>
	<li>
		Contain a reasonable logic to process and leverage the sensed data in real time
	</li>
	<li>
		Send an alert (e.g., an email, a slack message, a short message) when certain conditions are met. For example, for the active acoustic sensing or the capacitive sensing, an alert could be generated when your prototype detects a specific type of space (e.g., certain part of the classroom) or a specific property of an object (e.g., less than 1/3 detergent is left in a laundry detergent bottle)
	</li>
	<li>
		Be a stand-alone unit (that can be easily moved around) and look reasonably pleasing. For example, your team's protype can be housed in a 3D-printed or laser-cutted housing and powered by a battery unit.
	</li>
	<li>
		Must be able to be demonstrated live in class
	</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>See the notes below for details on each deliverable, including how to
turn them in, as well as grading criteria.</p>
<ol>
<li>A project proposal</li>
<li>Documentation in the form of an
     <a href="https://www.instructables.com/">Instructable</a> explaining how to
     recreate your project</li>
<li>Github Repository to store your team project code</li>
<li>A well-produced video demonstrating your project.</li>
<li>Weekly progress update about your team's project and your contributions.</li>
<li>A final in-class presentation and live-demo of your team's project</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>
<p>There are multiple steps for this assignment, with <a href="#important-dates">deliverable
dates</a>!</p>

<h3 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<p>This is a group project! You will work in a group of two or three. I will assign
groups based on your input.</p>

<p>You will, by the date
below (see <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a>), send me a private Slack
message that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A self-evaluation of the following skills: Photon Circult Construction, Photon Internet Connectivity, Sensing Technology Understanding, JavaScript/CSS/HTML Programming and Visualization, and Writing</li>
<li>A list of the people in the class whom you particularly <em>want</em> to
    work with, and reasons why.</li>
<li>(Optional) A list of the people in the class whom you particularly <em>do not</em>
    want to work with, and reasons why.</li>
<li>Or, if you do not have a preference of people that you do or don&rsquo;t want to work with, send me a message stating this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will form groups based on your feedback and aim to balance your team's skillsets.</p>
<!-- <p>See below under <a href="#group-requirements">Group requirements</a> for more
information about working in teams.</p> -->

<h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>
<p>Your team needs to turn in a proposal for your project. It should be a
well-written document, in PDF format, 2&ndash;3 pages long</p>
<p>Use this <a href="./ProposalTemplate.doc">template</a> that I have prepared to help your team think and construct your proposal. </p>

<h3 id="weekly-updates">Weekly Update</h3>
<p>After your team is formed, each Thursday by noon, you should compose a slack message answering the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What have you personally done technically on the project during the
    preceding week?</li>
<li>What design contributions have you personally made to the project
    during the preceding week?</li>
<li>What has your team mate (or mates) done technically and design-wise
    on the project during the preceding week?</li>
<li>What problems are you having with
	<ul>
<li>your team,</li>
<li>your project,</li>
<li>technology,</li>
<li>anything else?</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="documentation-video">Code, Documentation, and Video</h3>
<p>Your team needs to organize your code clearly with sufficient comments, and then upload it github.</p>

<p>In addition, your team needs to create documentation in the form of an <a href="https://www.instructables.com/">Instructable</a> explaining how to
     recreate your project. Include as many high-quality images as needed to demonstrate how to complete each step and what the unit would look like at each step. Also include code snippets and the github repository link(s) at appropriate in your Documentation. See <a href="#how-to-make-good-instructables">how-to-make-good-instructables</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you team needs to create a well-produced video, approximately one minute or two in length, to demonstrate the key components/features of your project and how it works. Tips: You can use <em>video prototyping</em> approach to have actors and narratives to help audience understand the problem that your team aims to tackle and how your project actually solves it.</li>


<h3 id="presentation-demo">Final Project Presentation, Live Demo, and Q & A</h3>
<p>Your team will give a presentation and a live-demo about your project in class. Each team has up to 15 minutes for the presenttion and live-demo. Afterward, each team has a Q&A session that is up to 5 minutes. Therefore, reherse your presentation and live-demo well in advance and prepare for potential questions.</p>
<p>All students are required to attend all the Final Project Presentation, Live Demo, and Q & A sessions. When you are not a presenter, you should be actively listening to other groups' presentations and ask questions.</p>

<!-- <li>Build an attractive ambient display that visualizes a source of online
    information that is relevant to your life:<ul>
<li>Is a working ambient display: <strong>(25%)</strong></li>
<li>Is attractive: <strong>(10%)</strong><ul>
<li>Note: attractive is subjective, but I&rsquo;m going to judge it. Consider
    using extra materials beyond 3D printing and laser cutting; using
    &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; techniques such as sanding and painting; using fabric;
    or encasing your project in a manufactured object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uses online information: <strong>(8%)</strong></li>
<li>Is relevant to your life: <strong>(2%)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There should be a clear mapping from the information to the
    visualization, such that you could explain the display to someone
    and they could understand it. <strong>(7%)</strong></li>
<li>The display should be nice looking/sounding/feeling and not
    obviously technological in nature. Ideally the output will happen in
    a creative, non-obvious way. For example, if it&rsquo;s based on light,
    showing a graph with LEDs is obvious (see <strong>Inspirations</strong>
    below). <strong>(13%)</strong><ul>
<li>Note this is different from &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your documentation <strong>(10%)</strong> should include:<ul>
<li>A description of the display, including pictures,</li>
<li>what choices you made for the information to display and the way
    you displayed it,</li>
<li>source code and 3D/2D model files,</li>
<li>a short (~1m) video showing your display in operation<ul>
<li>please ensure that you shoot your video in landscape orientation</li>
<li>please edit your video so it is interesting to watch</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Group participation<ul>
<li>You turn in the required group report by 5pm every Friday <strong>(5%)</strong></li>
<li>You have participated fully as part of your group <strong>(10%)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="group-requirements">Group requirements</h2>
<p>Each person in the group <strong>must do both technical and design work</strong>.</p>
<p>While I recognize that there are a variety of strengths in different
areas, each student in the class has worked very hard to make progress
in understanding the skills we&rsquo;ve learned, and I want to see evidence
of that progress from each person.</p>
<p>In order for me to be able to gauge this progress, at the end of each
week, by Friday at 5pm, each group member will send me a private Slack
message that lists the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>what you personally have done technically on the project during the
    preceding week;</li>
<li>what design contributions you personally have made to the project
    during the preceding week;</li>
<li>what your team mate (or mates) has done technically and design-wise
    on the project during the preceding week;</li>
<li>and any problems you are having<ul>
<li>with your team,</li>
<li>with your project,</li>
<li>technology,</li>
<li>anything else.</li>

<h3 id="how-to-use-your-photon-with-the-internet">How to use your Photon with the internet</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions at Particle&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/">Connecting Your
Device</a>.
If you&rsquo;re at home, your wifi setup should (probably) be easy. If
you&rsquo;re in the lab (and you should be!) it will be more irritating.
First, you&rsquo;ll need to do the connection instructions with <code>particle
serial wifi</code>. Connect to the <strong>RIT-Legacy</strong> network (note that the
name is case-sensitive!). You won&rsquo;t be able to actually do anything,
though, until you register your Photon. Next, go back into <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/#listening-mode">Listening
Mode</a>
and type <code>particle serial mac</code>. You&rsquo;ll get a MAC address (not related
to Macintosh). Copy this, then visit
<a href="https://start.rit.edu/Computers">start.rit.edu/Computers</a> and click
on &ldquo;Advanced Registration&rdquo;. Then paste in the MAC address and go
through the prompts. If it didn&rsquo;t work, let me know the error message
and the MAC address.</p>
<p>Now you should be ready to program. Remember to take out the
<code>SYSTEM_MODE(MANUAL)</code> line so your Photon can get on the internet.</p>
<p>You might want to test out some of Particle&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/">code
examples</a>.</p>
<p>Information on using the Photon itself with the internet can be found
in the <a href="https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#cloud-functions">Firmware
documentation</a>;
generic information on communicating with the Particle Cloud via your computer
is in the <a href="https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/">Cloud API
documentation</a>. However, you
probably will want to use Javascript, so read about that in the
<a href="https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/">Particle API for Javascript
docs</a>. There are APIs
for other languages listes
<a href="https://docs.particle.io/reference/community/">here</a>, and you can
find others by Googling (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/youngsoul/PyParticleIO">Python</a>).</p>
<h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of projects I found on
<a href="http://instructables.com/">Instructables</a>, with some comments. Note
that most of them are <em>not</em> ambient displays, but contain parts that I
think would be suitable for an ambient display, or otherwise
illustrate something I think is cool.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ambient-temperature-tapestry/">Ambient temperature
    tapestry</a>:
    This is a pretty good example of what I would like to see out of a class
    project. It&rsquo;s nice looking and it shows useful information. It doesn&rsquo;t
    connect to the net, and I would like it better with some less-obvious
    lights.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Programmable-Mechanical-Music-Box/">Mechanical music
    box</a>:
    It&rsquo;s not an ambient display but could be one. I particularly like
    the warm appearance and how it uses mechanical parts to make sound
    rather than a speaker.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Vibrating-Pixels-Mechanical-Mirror/">Vibrating
    mirror</a>:
    This mirror has nine little circles that can vibrate independently,
    distorting the image. This very neatly falls into the <em>enchanted
    object</em> paradigm.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/NeoWeather-Ambient-Weather-Indicator/">NeoWeather</a>:
    This project uses a ring of RGB LEDs to indicate various things,
    including the weather or package delivery status. I like its
    ability, but it would lose points for this assignment because it&rsquo;s
    very technological-looking and the output is pretty obvious&mdash;just
    LED lights. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Activated-Home-Run-Indicator/">Lego Mets home run
    indicator</a>:
    When the Mets have a home run announced on Twitter, the apple pops
    up! This is only semi-ambient, as it&rsquo;s really a binary display. I&rsquo;d
    like to see a version that somehow includes a subtle indication of
    current score.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Mood-Light-The-Worlds-Mood-in-a-Box/">Twitter mood
    light</a>:
    Indicates the current overall mood of Twitter via light. I&rsquo;d like it
    even better if the display was less LED-ish looking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/the-tweiger-counter/">Tweiger counter</a>:
    A &ldquo;Twitter Geiger counter&rdquo; which searches Twitter for particular
    words and makes a clicking sound, so you have an idea of the
    &ldquo;density&rdquo; of tweets on a particular subject. It also has a meter.
    This project would get an A.</li>
