&lt;p>The Human-Computer Interaction Top Conference - ACM CHI 2023, announced the acceptance results this morning. Seven papers from our APEX group were accepted. The first-author of six papers are PhD students supervised by Prof. Mingming Fan, five of whom are first-year PhD students. Congratulations to the students and collaborators in the group! Our accepted work contributes to two major domains: 1) improving the accessibility of technology to the elderly and the disablabled people, working towards the broad goal of information accessibility; 2) exploring theories and methods of intelligent user experience analysis, and improving the shortcomings of traditional user experience analysis methods in human-computer interaction. Specific project details will be shared later!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
